Title = '(05) NATS Receiving'
weight = 500
+++

This lesson is to to explain the concepts of nats and build a program that
can handle being "sent" markdown content from the nats CLI.  

The implementation should just run goldmark (via the previous lesson's API) and then
send the resulting HTML to the display.

We have to explain enough of the CLI to show how you can have multiple listeners,
one in the server showing data on the browse, and another that just displays
the result via the NATS CLI.

I have a couple of type-safe wrappers that work on top of NATS and use 
generics to insure the type-safety.  E.g. You can "subscribe" to a subject
for which you don't have the correct type declared as your "Receive" method.
