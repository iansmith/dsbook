The title of this book is _Simplicity Is A Virtue_ and not only is this claim correct,
but we will be emphasizing it a great deal in future chapters.  Many books, and 
countless Ph.D. theses,
have been written about complexity being the bane of software development.  The positions
taken and remedies suggested by these many authors are all-over-the-map, but it is safe to
say that nobody is _in favor of adding complexty._

*Snark*:What did Robespierre do related to virtue in the early 1790s? Well, he
invented an entirely new religion based on _the god of virtue_ and planned to 
impose it on all of France.  With himself as the high priest, of course.
Robespierre == DHH?

* Not sure what example to use here to illustrate the complexity and diffilut interactions
    between tools/frameworks -- the tailwind build procdure?  Single out js frameworks?

### The Javascript Framework Du Jour

{{% columns ratio="3:1" %}} <!-- begin columns block -->
Although many are familiar with this problem, it bears repeating: Software never shrinks
it only expands.  You might notice this because you install some javascript tool and
you end up installing 147 packages in your `node_modules`.

The Javascript community, especially those that work on the browser part of applications seem to
be in a perverse re-run of Groundhog day.  

* Yay, we've released the first preview release of new tool \<whatevs\>! This
is a moneumental day because you no longer are going to be forced to use the old
framework \<blah\> anymore because _whatevs_ is smaller, faster, better, easier
to use, and can make a mango milkshake.  Don't succumb to the bloatware of
_blah_! It's simply too big and complex to get anything serious done with! 
_Whatevs_ is the smaller, simpler future!

* Numerous people  begin trolling and pointing out all the features of the many previous
_blahs_ that are done badly or totally missing in _whatevs._  The developers of
_whatevs_ dutifully begin adding in bad copies of the requested features. 
_Whatevs_ begins increasing in size...

* Today is a momemntous day in front end developmen with the release of 
\<fleazil\>.  Don't succumb to working with the bloated and complex _whatevs_
framework! The time is now to switch to \<fleazil\> because ... 

Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

The title of this collection of babel and drivel is "Simplicity Is A Virtue"
with a longer subtitle.  This choice is not an accident, even if we sometimes
wander far afield from _our lane_.  One reason that this is a fine title for a work such as this
is, well, it's true.  There are, in fact, others.

We also consider "The backend developers are coming for your jobs! Flee in terror!"
But that seemed a bit too long.

Sometimes in this book you will see sidebars that explain the _why_ of tools that we
use and use in this book, especially datastar. We've not chosen these tools
because they the embodiment of simplicity (although some are).  We've chosen them
because the _idea_ that
needs to be communicate with someone else for them to understand what the tool
does is small, clear, and doesn't need a thick book and a lawyer to get the hang of it.
