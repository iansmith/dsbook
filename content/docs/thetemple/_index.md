# Lesson 3: The Temple Of Templ 

In this lesson you are going to learn about templ.  The good news for you, dear
reader, is that templ has excellent documentation and support for a templ
template highlight in editors like vscode, vim, etc.  Since the documentation
is quite good, we're not to spend a lot of time on the particulars of a particular
feature of templ, we'll just link their docs.

You'll notice in the files for this lesson we have moved the timer to the top
right corner of the UI, that's where it will be in the final ui.  

This lesson should supply them with the templ templates for just the clock part
and the primary exercise should be adapting the countdown bit to use templ.
