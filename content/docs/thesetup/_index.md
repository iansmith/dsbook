# Lesson 0: The Set-Up

The name of this lesson is taken from the beginning of the movie _The Sting_
with Paul Newman and Robert Redford.

## Lesson summary
At the end of this lesson you should be able to:
* Run all the necessary tools for building and running a real datastar project.
* Run your _enable script_ to set up your environment and tooling.

You should also know:

* The basic purpose of the tools that we are going to be using to build this application,
even if you don't know them in detail.
* The purpose and theory of the `enable script` and, if you are an advanced user, why you don't want to use it.
* Whether or not you should be reading this book--we hope you will be!
* How to understand the formatting convention that we use in this book, "is that a file
showing a shell script or a shell script that I should enter?"
* What resources you can consult if your project (or our documentation!) gets seriously hosed.
