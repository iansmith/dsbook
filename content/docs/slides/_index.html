This version will show the golang api to sending on a subject.  Naturally,
I plan to use my type-safe versions to make this easier.

This version will read in all the slides (markdown files) in advance at startup.
These slides will then be something that you can move through with the 
arrow keys.  It just blasts the data into the subject and assumes the other
end will display it.

This is something that you might actually call a prezo tool, but there is much
more to do.
